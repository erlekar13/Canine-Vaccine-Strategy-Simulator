# Canine-Vaccine-Strategy-Simulator
Canine-Vaccine-Strategy-Simulator Designed and implemented a Java-based simulation to model infection spread in urban dog populations, applying graph algorithms and epidemic modeling to compare vaccination strategies (Random, High-Degree, High-Risk Area). Evaluated outcomes across multiple runs to identify the most effective approach.

A simulation tool designed to optimize dog vaccination strategies for effective disease control and prevention.  
This project models different vaccination approaches, helping to analyze outcomes and support decision-making in public health campaigns.  

## Features
- Simulates vaccination strategies for canines  
- Helps optimize vaccination coverage  
- Supports decision-making for effective disease prevention
